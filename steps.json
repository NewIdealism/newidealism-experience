    "context": "We keep blaming social media for the surge in anxiety and depression, but that’s the surface story. The deeper problem is a meaning crisis Nietzsche saw coming: as we tore down old certainties in the name of truth, our “highest values” started to collapse, and a quiet nihilism moved in. When life stops feeling meaningful, people don’t just get sad - they get anxious, restless, and mentally exhausted, because there’s no solid “why” holding everything together. Vervaeke’s short nails this in a punchy way: it links today’s mental health strain to a broader collapse of meaning and orientation, and that’s the real root issue we have to push through.",
